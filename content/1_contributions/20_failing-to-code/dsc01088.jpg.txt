Alt: Someone is shining a light onto a sensor that is embedded into where the eye should be in a small, cute (or creepy?) hand stitched fabric doll. The doll belongs to the aunt of the maker and she made it when she was a child â€“ it has been in the family for a while. In their hand they pull on a knitted sensor that is sewn into where the ear should be. The scene is messy, there electronic components and wires about.
