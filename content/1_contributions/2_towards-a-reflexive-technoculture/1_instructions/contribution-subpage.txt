### MATERIALS
- 8-16 participants (note: if possible, all participants should be compensated in some way for their time and labor, financially or otherwise)
- Workshop prompts (see below)
- 2 to 3 hours of undisturbed, focused time
- Collaborative writing tool (Digital or physical; this can range from online collaborative writing software to Post-Its on a wall. The important thing is that people are able to create some kind of shared space together, where ideas can actively build on and connect to each other.)

### STEPS
1. **Open the workshop with a land acknowledgement**. As we think about constructing more liberatory futures for ourselves and our work, it is important to note that the first step towards undoing systems of oppression is to understand the ways in which we are inextricably linked to settler colonialist practices. While a small gesture, a land acknowledgement is the first step in examining questions of embeddedness and complicity, which are the major themes running through this workshop.

2. **Have everyone go around the room and introduce themselves.** In addition to their names, participants should include the following information:

a. Preferred pronouns
b. Current location (if a virtual workshop)
c. Any important designations that they feel contribute to how they see themselves in the world, e.g. hometown, age, gender identity, ethnicity, etc. 

Participants can use any, all, or none of these categories, but the important thing is that they spend some time grounding the group in how they see themselves within the world, and what social and identity markers are crucial for that positioning.

Please ask participants to refrain from talking about their job, experience working with code or technology, or anything else related to these ideas, as they will be probed in-depth throughout the workshop.

3. **Freewriting.** Read prompt 1 aloud to the group, and allow for 10-15 minutes of individual freewriting time in response. The facilitator should participate in this freewriting as well. Be sure to emphasize that there should be no filter on what is written; encourage participants to write thoughts down in response to these prompts as they come, and to let themselves be directed wherever the exercise takes them. If this is done in a large group, the freewriting stage can be done in pairs.

4. **Discussion.** Bring everyone back to the larger group, and ask for volunteers to share selections from what they wrote (in a smaller group you might go around the room and have everyone read something). Tell the group to make note of things that people say that resonate with them, that feel familiar, or that spark ideas.

After the group is finished sharing, allow time for responses from the group, in which these resonant ideas can be brought to the surface and shared with everyone else. Allow this to go on in an organic fashion, and transition to the next step when it feels good to do so.

5. Repeat the freewriting and discussion steps for prompts 2-6.

6. **Contract building.** Direct participants to the collaborative writing tool you have selected for this workshop, whatever that might be. The writing surface should be split into four spaces, according to the following prompts:

a. “We uphold the status quo by...”
b. “We want to change the status quo because...”
c. “Our ideal vision of the future is...”
d. “To reach our future vision, we commit to ...”

Have participants work together to finish these statements. This can be done in one large group, in smaller groups, or individually with participants actively building off of others’ contributions.

When the contract is done, have all of the participants sign and date it, document it, and make a copy for everyone who has participated to take with them. If everyone feels comfortable, exchange contact information or set up an email listserv to help foster accountability and support as everyone attempts to stick to these goals going forward.

### Freewriting Prompts 
1. How would you describe your relationship with technology?
*What do you use technology for in your own work? How do you identify as a coder, programmer, developer, or technical designer? What are your technical contributions to this ecosystem, and how do you see yourself integrating into it?*

2. What, as you see it in your own work, is the technological status quo?
*What are the norms and defaults? What is taken for granted? Here you should make an effort to think about the things that you do in your technical practice that operate subconsciously or on autopilot. What don’t you ask questions about? What is assumed to be “normal”?*

3. Where do you attempt to break the status quo?
*What do you do in your practice to oppose the rules and structures that you feel to be problematic? How do you see yourself already moving towards a more equitable programming practice?*

4. Where do you uphold the status quo?
*This gets a little trickier. Take an honest look at the ways in which you might actively be supporting existing systems, or systems that perpetuate power inequalities, bias, and social hierarchy in technology. Where might your privileges be blinding you? Where might you be benefiting from pre-existing structures? If you feel yourself getting defensive or uncomfortable, try to check in with those feelings and ask yourself why you might be experiencing them so intensely.*

5. Who do I want my work to be for? Who is my work really for?
*Who is actually engaging with the work you are doing? How does this match up with who you envision your work for? Do your ideal audience and your actual audience line up?*

6. What is my vision for a more utopian technological future?
*What is your goal for a more equitable technical practice? What would be ideal, and what work do you personally need to do to help get there?*
