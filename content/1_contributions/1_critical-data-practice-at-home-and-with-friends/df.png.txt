Caption: An example set of “book-end” slides. At the beginning of any presentation (keeping lecture to a minimum) within a course, I highlight all the topics covered I the course already, and then highlight today’s theme. At the end of any talk, I briefly show the list again to remind what we have covered. I try to always connect the general principle to something concrete, but it may be a different example or question based on the theme of that class. Repetition is a powerful teacher.
