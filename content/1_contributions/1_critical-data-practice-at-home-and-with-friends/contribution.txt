Contextone: Over the past decade, I’ve kept one foot in art-making, and another in code work. Personally, I experimented with journaling and self-reflection since 2008, bringing art (and sometimes code) into this very personal practice. In 2020, after feedback to some of this artwork, I realized that many people have a difficult relationship to technology (not surprising), and that it was helpful to use self-tracking data visualization to engage with broader socio-technical issues (initially very surprising). For the past 1.5 years, I hosted several workshops, and had dozens of conversations on technology-mediated self-reflection, and this recipe builds on those.

----

Contexttwo: This recipe is for everyone with a little bit of interest in working with data as art material; especially people who feel skeptical about collecting data about themselves. I do offer some specific resources. However, my primary goal is to share the idea that something like, for example, making drawings based on your sleep tracker data with a few other people can be a powerful starting point for important discussion of the role of technology in our daily life, and how we want to change it.

----

Contextthree: The lens of intersectionality recognizes how each person’s overlapping identities contribute to discrimination or privilege. There are many books on how technology encodes existing discriminatory practices or structures. But the fact that we each use technology in isolation makes this fact often feel theoretical (including often to those who are affected by technological bias). This recipe suggests applying the principles of (link: https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/ text: Data Feminism) to data practice, but crucially also proposes “self-tracking” as a group activity. This allows us to see how limited, imperfect, and biased data collection and data tooling can be in a direct way.

----

Shortdesctext: Many of us have difficult relationship to technology that can feel unresolved and isolating. I have found that combining art-making and group discussion about personal data practice can be a joyful and productive method for engaging with such difficulties. Though some of the ideas in this recipe have been slowly developing over a decade of personal art practice, they were brought into being while teaching two courses on the subject at Berlin's School of Machines, and through ongoing collaborations. I initially intended to support critical engagement with the methods of the “quantified self,” and, through the discussions that ensued, realized that working with personal data can be a powerful site of engagement with broader socio-technical issues that felt both looming and out of reach to many participants.

Working with personal data can lead well to interrogating all aspects of how data is produced and handled, and these can be applied to broader societal issues. This approach also lowers the barrier to entry: it is invigorating to create personally meaningful objects from the start. The output is expressive art that can exist on its own, while the process can scaffold critical technical discourse.\n\n####Cookware####\n1.

Klein.\n1. In the rest of this document, I offer some reflections on my experiences teaching, learning, and organizing discussions that I hope can spark ideas on how to hold space for confronting complexity and uncertainty collaboratively.\n\n####Data Inventory Excercise####\n#####Context#####\nWorking with your own data plunges you into the thick of difficult human-technology relationships. Tools for self-tracking are entrenched in a neoliberal political rationality that is present in other technologies, too. Deborah Lupton writes in the *Quantified Self* that:\n\n>*...apparatuses of \u2018soft\u2019 rather than \u2018hard\u2019 power...[are not] coercive measures that appear to be imposed from above... People attempt to become productive workers... because they see it as a way toward achieving their optimal selves*\n\nand such practices of self-optimization\n\n>*appear to emerge from personal desires and voluntary objectives... rather from imperatives issues by the state of other sources of authority.*\n\nAlthough some definitions of \u201cself-tracking\u201d emphasize conscious, deliberate data collection, there is a vast amount of data being collected that we could access, but usually don\u2019t; as well as data we have no control over or access to.\n\nOne possible approach to self-reflection and group discussion is to create a **data inventory**.\n\n#####Steps#####\n1. List as many existing personal data sources as you can (e.g.: Screen Time; Calendar)\n1. For each:\n    - What would be an obvious finding from this data?\n    - What would be a surprising finding?\n    - How long does this data need to be collected to be valuable for me?\n1. For the whole list:\n    - What data sources are complementary?\n    - What data sources help validate a surprising finding?\n\n#####Tips#####\nTo use this in a group setting, either in teaching or as a discussion topic, introduce the idea early in a session. Then, during discussion, participants may keep adding things they didn\u2019t consider; one outcome from this exercise is a feeling of accumulating awareness. This might itself be a difficult feeling. The above list highlights the benefit to oneself; the discussion can then go on to ask: \n\n> *What is the cost to individuals? To society? Are there data sources here that are not valuable for us, and what pathways if any are there to modify what data is collected and how? Why does this data exist in the first place?*\n\nWorking with any data makes discussion less abstract, including discussing how many consumer technologies often intentionally hide data work from view to create a sense of seamlessness. This can bring intersectional feminism into data practice on a practical level; I use the Data Feminism principles outlined by D\u2019Ignazio and Klein to structure any lecture material. \n\nColloquial understanding of \u201cthe algorithm\u201d on social media suggests a false stability to systems. In *Algorithms of Oppression*, Noble details many examples of search engines being described as neutral or inscrutable; then, after sufficient pressure, being reviewed, found to be biased, and sometimes changed. Critique and revision is possible, so a critical data practice that starts at home doesn\u2019t have to stay there."},"id":"78538564-d4b4-4ad4-8790-217159250609","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}],"id":"75c6918d-5fe3-46d0-b291-85e82b65f11e","width":"1\/1"}],"id":"dcf5f460-6aff-4f2c-9834-545c1cbe1b84"},{"attrs":[],"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["df.png"],"src":"","alt":"Two slides, each listing seven principles of data feminism.
