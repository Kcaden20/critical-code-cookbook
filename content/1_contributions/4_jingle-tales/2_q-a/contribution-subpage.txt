####What is the context or background that inspired your recipe?####

We, at Janastu, build decentralised Community Owned Wi-Fi [COW] mesh networks and inclusive technology. We have been hacking together an unPC: a not-so-personal computer, with a Raspberry Pi core, called the Aamne Saamne Pi (ASPi). It is a community-owned white box laptop which facilitates the creation, discovery, and re-narration of community expressions. This involves the young women asserting their identity and voicing their opinions, expressing their likes and dislikes in a safe space away from the prying eyes of the algorithm. To be able to do these things, just a slight prompt works wonders: which here was to customize the bootup sound.

####Which community are you offering the recipe to?####

Janastu actively engaged in a dialogue with young women from a few villages in Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh, India through the Work 4 Progress project. Originally the recipe was made for young rural women in traditional labor and skill contexts; typically low literate, and unconnected or unable to discover or publish useful content on the internet, for their collective needs of skill development and entrepreneurial aspirations. However, this recipe is for all who want to tinker with their Pi devices and have Raspbian OS installed. Itâ€™s a way for someone to claim their devices, and in the process maybe find purposeful communities to actively engage with.

####How does your submission relate to intersectional feminism?####

While phones might be most familiar in low literate contexts, they are inherently personal devices and carry stigma for the women who use them. In low income areas they are generally unavailable to the women and the low literate members of a household. Looking from the lens of intersectional feminism, devices could instead be inclusive, available to a group and adaptable to different contexts. In above contexts it is important to nurture a safe and cohesive community as exposure to the Internet increases. ASPi and the recipe act as catalysts that go a long way to making devices inclusive, accessible, playable and open to exploration.
