Alt: The first image shows a hacker news website featuring my CryptoCrochet-Key project. The article states “Anuradha Reddy’s CryptoCrochet-Key Gives You a Unique, Huggable Security Token for Home IoT.” The second image on the top right is the software application called ‘Teachable Machine’ where I’m training the Machine to learn how my crochet key looks using my computer webcam. The third image on the bottom right is a picture of my hand with the key testing on a Raspberry Pi computer.
