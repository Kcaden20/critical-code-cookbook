Contextone:

Bringing failure to the centre of learning is a fertile space to engage in coding or computing. As educators, we know that the ways of being in the world are fundamental to how we learn, and learning new knowledge is interwoven with our backgrounds, contexts, situations, and perspectives.
 
I am inspired by ideas from the *Queer Art of Failure* (Halberstam, 2014) because of the relationship that Halberstam draws between ways of being and ways of knowing. Learning computational thinking from queer perspectives on failure brings into question some of the capitalist structures that uphold coding knowledges, such as the concept of binary, solution based approaches, hierarchies of knowing, or individualism.

----

Contexttwo:

I offer this recipe to coding educators from both non-formal and formal education spaces who’d like to experiment with refusing to think like a computer. Rather than step-by-step, this recipe is based on “flavors” that are aimed as inspiring educators for the context they work in.
 
Over the past few years I have been working closely with educators in non-formal learning communities (such as Knowle West Media Centre in Bristol, UK). I have taught coding (usually using p5.js or Arduino), and I’ve also observed and learned from other educators' work. This recipe reflects this non-formal approach, where activities are flexible and adapted to support learners from different contexts or backgrounds.

----

Contextthree:

*Failing to CODE* aims to challenge and subvert hierarchical knowledge practices by offering suggestions for multiple ways of connecting to code activities, and also to each other. It is positioned outside of dominant hierarchies in knowledge practices, such individualism, linear modes of success, or binary thinking.
 
As well as drawing from queer feminist perspective, this work relates to ideas from feminist pedagogue bell hooks, who suggests that learning (and knowing) is based on full-bodied ways of being in the world. The recipe also relates to feminist computer scientist Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, who describes the material development of software as gendered.

----

Shortdesctext: *Failing to CODE* is a way of approaching computing education, it can be used to support educators to expand their creative coding pedagogical practice. The aim of the resource is to explore plurality in learning styles through working with ideas from feminist pedagogies. This recipe is a bit like giving some “flavor inspirations” to the cookbook – the aim is to inspire an expanded way rather than step-by-step. Educators can take on elements of the characteristics into their practice in the way that works best for them.

Bodycont:

>*...we might read failure, for example as a refusal of master, a critique of the intuitive within capitalism between success and profit, and as a counterhegmonic discourse of losing. Stupidity could refer not simple to a lack of knowledge but to the limits of certain forms of knowing and certain ways of inhabiting structures of knowing.*
– Jack Halberstam, *The Queer Art of Failure*

In this recipe I introduce “flavors” that characterize failure based on a reading of The Queer Art of Failure. These are characteristics of failure such as stupidity, losing, unmaking, undoing, unbecoming, or not knowing or acts that are small, antimonumental, and irrelevant. I describe examples of how these flavors might be part of a learning experience – based on activities I have developed in my practice as an educator. I then go on to introduce some of the concepts that helped shape these flavors, and make some connections between failure, pedagogy and computing.

####Stupidity####

>*Stupidity could refer not simply to a lack of knowledge but to the limits of certain forms of knowing and certain ways of inhabiting structures of knowing.*
– Jack Halberstam, *The Queer Art of Failure*

The potato print's apparent stupidity demonstrates their failure as knowledge in the computing context. Potato printing resonates with not knowing in this space, with potential for further “detours, twists, and turns through knowing and confusion” (Halberstam, 2014). They are teaching us to know from unknowing ways, with humor.

####Unmaking####

She refers to programmers as \u201cusers\u201d to illustrate that they are constructed by the conventions of programming languages, rather than possessing the agency that is commonly perceived coding has.\n\nThe conditions in which programming developed have shaped it to how it is now. Chun threads the stories of machine materiality, gendered languages of control, and hierarchical social interactions, to re-position the history of computing as an entanglement of these (rather than a static, linier discipline). Based on this historic materialism, Chun illuminates the limitations of the computing discipline, and argues that software is ideology.\n\nLearning about coding technologies from queer perspectives on failure brings into question some of the capitalist structures that uphold coding technologies, such as the concept of binary, solution based approaches, hierarchies or individualism. The role of *Failing to CODE* is to use learning objects to question the foundations of computing knowledge, as a way to cut through the ideological construct that has been developed from the entanglement of material conditions of its production. Bringing objects of failure to the centre of learning is a full body engagement in coding and computing."},"id":"4cab5265-fba5-4222-914f-503bfc893ccf","isHidden":false,"type":"markdown"}],"id":"c6e784ba-1c40-4634-afdc-0b40b36c5312","width":"1\/1"}],"id":"9709a7b7-c7f6-4d8a-a9d5-aff3459f4343"}]
