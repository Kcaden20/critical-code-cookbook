Alt: The main PAC-MOM maze is pictured (in the aesthetic style of the traditional PAC MAN game.) This shows PAC-MOM in yellow, at the center of the maze. She has to avoid red, blue, and green colored ghosts labeled “Patriarchy”, “Racism”, “Transphobia”, among many more. She has three lives. This is indicated by two PAC-MOM yellow icons on the lower left corner of the screen.
