Alt: A black and white photo of an audio-visual live coding performance. A woman and a man stand behind a table covered with a microphone, cables, and two computer screens. A large projection of code covers them and the wall behind them. The woman to the left has light skin, her face is slightly obscured by the pattern the code projection makes on her body. She wears a dark garment with thin straps. She is looking down at something that is not visible on the table. The man stands to the right. He also has light skin, and his features are also obscured by the code projected onto him. He has a short haircut, glasses, and a dark long sleeved top. He appears to be manipulating something on the table as part of the performance.
