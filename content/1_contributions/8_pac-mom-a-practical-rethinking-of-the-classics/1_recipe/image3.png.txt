Alt: The PAC-MOM level selection screen. Against a black background there is a heading in yellow text constrained within a red rectangle that says “PAC-MOM level seletion. Underneath the heading it says in white text: “Play the training level to find out why PAC-MOM has to work harder for food pellets than PAC-MAN! … or play the main level. At the bottom left corner in white, there is a button for volume control. Next to it in the middle in yellow text over a blue rectangle there are two buttons where players can choose to play the training level or the main level. By Annina Rüst. Share however you want.
