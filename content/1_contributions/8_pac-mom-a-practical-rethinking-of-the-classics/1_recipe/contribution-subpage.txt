1. Find “classic” games (or other media artifacts) that are part of the “canon” in a  specific genre. 
2. Identify conceptual aspects in these games that seem culturally antiquated and are  ripe for re-interpretation.
3. Modify the rhetoric of the chosen game to create an outcome that reveals  something about social inequities and intersectional identities that the original game  is unable to do.  
4. Test your concept with an intersectional audience. Integrate feedback.  

Note: The ingredients of humor and irony can help make hard truths more palatable and easier  to digest. 

My questions for creators of this kind of project are: 
- How can you make a game parody that is  more than just ironic? 
- How can you modify the rhetoric of a classical game to expand what it is and how it works in culture? 
- How can new classics be created that examine the past,  communicate contemporary reality, and help us create a better future where a multitude of feminisms exist and are taken seriously in game development and in society more broadly?
