Alt: This is the PAC-MOM “you lost” screen. This screen offers useless patronizing advice to PAC-MOM including “Maybe you should been more confident?”, “Maybe you should have smiled more?”, “Maybe you should have ‘leaned in’ more”, and many more. Inspiration for this screen is drawn from self-help literature directed at women in the workplace. By Annina Rüst. Share however you want.
