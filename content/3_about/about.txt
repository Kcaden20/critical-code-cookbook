This beginning, buoyed by the industrial revolution and militarization, fostered an embedded set of values into computation aligned with an ideology of standardization, optimization, and flawlessness. \u201cGood\u201d code is efficient code that operates on a scarcity mindset, limited by hardware and energy resources.\u00a0<\/p><p>And yet, there are histories to math, engineering, and computing that are less prominently recognized because they do not neatly fit into the narratives of capitalist production. Ada Lovelace and her contribution to the development of modern computing has only recently been more broadly recognized. Textile production, which led to the invention of the Jacquard Loom, was a great inspiration to Charles Babbage\u2019s research. Gendered and racialized preconceptions greatly impact what is validated as technical and creative work. We believe that it is time to confront how computational history has been retrofitted to tell a single narrative by recentering marginalized ways of knowing. For example, one may trace back to <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jiaobei\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">poe divination<\/a> to gain a new perspective on the boolean variables. <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Quipu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quipu<\/a> may be seen as one of the oldest examples of data storage. Fractals, which are often reduced to mathematical formulas in computer science classrooms can be traced back to multiple beginnings throughout ancient history such as <a href=\"https:\/\/monoskop.org\/images\/f\/fc\/Eglash_Ron_African_Fractals_Modern_Computing_and_Indigenous_Design.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">traditional African architecture<\/a>.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The Critical Coding Cookbook perceives history as a messy entanglement rather than a linear graph. There is a growing awareness towards reclaiming ancestral knowledge and a movement to decolonize computation. Through centering marginalized bodies and identities, we aim to build a collection of alternative histories, narratives, and approaches to computation. This volume of material can serve as an open-source educational resource across a spectrum of learning communities.<\/p>"},"id":"793e206a-1a88-4930-b905-0a3fd33742f4","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}],"id":"ea4b3387-3dab-43e9-b2a1-32c0a4a0115c","width":"1\/1"}],"id":"ac33f03d-5a00-4d72-b7c4-b120e28368aa"},{"attrs":[],"columns":[{"blocks":[{"content":{"level":"h2","text":"Acknowledgements"},"id":"5c09ecea-5873-43f5-81ac-52e78bbebc22","isHidden":false,"type":"heading"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The Critical Code Cookbook is a product of many people's work and labor.
